# Blinkit Sales Dashboard  

## Project Objective  
This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** built to analyze the **sales performance of Blinkit**.  

The dashboard provides key insights into:  
- Sales trends  
- Product performance  
- Outlet types  
- Customer preferences  

The goal of this dashboard is to enable **data-driven decisions** by visualizing important business metrics such as **total sales, average sales, item ratings, outlet sizes, and product categories**.

## Questions or Queries  

The dashboard is designed to answer the following key business questions:  

1. What is the **total sales** across all outlets?  
2. What is the **average sales per item**?  
3. How many **items** are being sold in total?  
4. What is the **average customer rating** of items?  
5. Which **item types** generate the highest sales?  
6. How do **low-fat vs. regular-fat** items contribute to total sales?  
7. How are sales distributed across **different outlet sizes** (Small, Medium, High)?  
8. How do sales vary by **outlet location type** (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)?  
9. What is the **trend of sales over the years** (based on outlet establishment year)?  
10. Which **outlet type** (Grocery Store, Supermarket Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) performs best in terms of:  
   - Total sales

The following steps were followed to create the **Blinkit Sales Dashboard**:  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Obtained the Blinkit sales dataset containing details about items, outlets, sales, and ratings.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Removed duplicates.  
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., Outlet Size, Item Type, Fat Content).  
   - Converted data into a clean tabular format for analysis.  

3. **Data Analysis**  
   - Explored sales patterns across different outlets.  
   - Identified relationships between item types, fat content, and sales.  
   - Analyzed outlet performance based on size, type, and location.  

4. **Dashboard Design in Power BI**  
   - Created calculated columns and measures for KPIs (e.g., Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items).  
   - Built charts such as bar charts, donut charts, and line charts for insights.  
   - Applied filters and slicers for interactivity (e.g., by outlet size, location type, or fat content).  

5. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Designed an interactive, visually appealing dashboard.  
   - Highlighted KPIs like **Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating**.
